## üöÄ Features

- **File-based routing** with [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router)
- **State management, data fetching, and caching** with [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query)
- Build tools powered by [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
- Comprehensive linting & formatting with [Biome](https://biomejs.dev/)
- Package management with [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- Internalization (i18n) support with [paraglide-js](https://inlang.com/m/gerre34r/library-inlang-paraglideJs)

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.2.0 or higher
- Setup of an back-end starter project (for example, [spring-rest-api-starter-template](https://github.com/dung204/spring-rest-api-starter-template))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (highly recommended)

## üì¶ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dung204/tanstack-start-starter-template.git
```

2. Change directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd tanstack-start-stater-template
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

4. Setup and start the back-end server (follow the README instructions in the back-end starter project).

5. Configure the back-end API URL in the `.env` file, for example:

```env
# Change this to your back-end API URL
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/v1
```

6. Start the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

7. Open your browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173) to see the application in action.

8. (Optional) If using VS Code, head over to the Extensions tab and install the recommended extensions from [`.vscode/extensions.json`](.vscode/extensions.json). This will help you with linting, formatting, and overall development experience.
