## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/) 1.2.0 or higher
- Setup of the back-end project ([fu-oj-backend](https://github.com/dung204/fu-oj-backend))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (highly recommended)

## üì¶ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dung204/fu-oj-frontend.git
```

2. Change directory to the project folder:

```bash
cd fu-oj-frontend
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install --frozen-lockfile
```

4. Setup and start the back-end server (follow the [README instructions](https://github.com/dung204/fu-oj-backend/blob/main/README.md) in the back-end project).

5. Create the `.env` file in the root of the project and configure the back-end API URL, for example:

```env
# Change this to your back-end API URL
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000/api/v1
```

6. Start the development server:

```bash
bun dev
```

7. Open your browser and navigate to [`http://localhost:5173`](http://localhost:5173) to see the application in action.

8. (Optional) If using VS Code, head over to the Extensions tab and install the recommended extensions from [`.vscode/extensions.json`](.vscode/extensions.json). This will help you with linting, formatting, and overall development experience.
