# üìÅ File-based routing with TanStack Router

The project uses TanStack Router for file-based routing. The routes are defined in the `src/routes` directory. Each file corresponds to a route in the application. The following are the recommended official docs to get started:

- [Routing Concepts](https://tanstack.com/router/latest/docs/framework/react/routing/routing-concepts)
